This is an analysis of the patterns of reading and math scores of each high school in the district.
All individual student scores can be reviewed in the data table if desired.
First, you will see a summary of budget and average reading and math scores for the entire district, indicating that across 15 schools, only 65% of students are passing both reading and math.
Next, you will see a breakdown of budget and average scores by school. What becomes immediately clear in this table is that no matter the budget, charter schools significantly outperform district schools in reading and math performance.
The next two tables confirm this, showing that the top 5 performing schools are all charter schools with around a 90% success rate, and the bottom 5 performing schools are all district schools, all around 50%.
Next, math and reading scores are broken down by grade level. There does not appear to be any significant change in scores across grade levels.
Finally, we break down schools by spending, size, and type. We see that schools with higher budgets per students tend to have a lower percentage of students passing both math and reading, small and medium sized schools tend to outperform large schools, and, as we saw in our first table, charter schools outperform district schools.
If these factors are causal and not just correlational, the district should look into reducing school sizes to 2000 students or below, spending money more efficiently, and increasing the number of charter schools in the district.
